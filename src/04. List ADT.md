# List ADT
## Introduction
Consider another ADT: the List. The text looks at it as a collection of objects in a **specific order** and having the same data type.
- Note that this **does NOT mean** the data is sorted
- We also want to keep track of the number of objects in the collection
- Operations:
	- `add(newEntry)`
	- `add(newPosition, newEntry)`
	- `remove(givenPosition)`
	- `clear()`
	- `replace(givenPosition, newEntry)`
	- `getEntry(givenPosition)`
	- `toArray()`
	- `contains(anEntry)`
	- `getLength()`
	- `isEmpty()

Note that in the author's implementation, indexing begins at 1, not 0.

## From the User's Point of View:
A List is a very general and useful structure
- We can use it for Last In First Out behavior
- We can use it for First in First Out behavior
- We can access the data by index and add/remove at a given location
- We can search for an item within the list
- We could use it as a bag...But it would requires additional Bag methods

Important Note: It may not be the ideal ADT for some of these behaviors. However, we may choose to use it because it can do ALL of these things.

See [Example8.java](handout/Example8.java)

## Standard Java List Interface
Standard Java has a List interface which is a superset of the operations in author's `ListInterface`.
- Some operations have different names
- Special cases may be handled differently
- **Indexing starts at 0**
- But the idea is the same
  
See Java API - You should already be familiar with ArrayList implementation of the standard List([Example8b.java](handout/Example8b.java))

## From the Implementer's Point of View
In implementing a list, we must somehow represent a collection of items (Objects) and its logical size. And, as discussed previously, the implementation of the operations will be closely related to the representation of the data. Minimally the data representation will "suggest" ways of implementing the operations.

### Linked-based Implementation
Let’s first implement our `ListInterface` using a **linked data structure**. Much of the implementation is identical to our LinkedBag:
1. Singly-linked list structure
2. Node inner class with data and next fields
3. Adding a new item at the front of the list is identical
4. Finding an item in the list is identical

However, there are some important differences between the two:
1. The List interface requires data to be kept in **positional order**. Thus, we cannot arbitrarily move data around.
	- Recall that the Bag always removed Nodes from the front and moved data to allow arbitrary delete.
2. We can also insert and remove in a given position. We will need to add and remove Nodes from the middle of the list.
	- Note that this was not needed for LinkedBag

Consider the `remove(int givenposition)` method:
1. First, we must get to the object at givenPosition `i`. We can use a private method `getNodeAt()` to do this
```Java
/** Task: Returns a reference to the node at a given position.
 *  Precondition: List is not empty; 1 <= givenPosition <= length. */
private Node getNodeAt(int givenPosition)
{
	// List should be non-empty
	// 1 <= givenPosition <= numberOfEntries
	Node currentNode = firstNode;
	// traverse the list to locate the desired node
	for (int counter = 1; counter < givenPosition; counter++)
		currentNode = currentNode.getNextNode();
	// currentNode should not be null here
	return currentNode;
} // end getNodeAt
```
- Note that we start at the front of the list and follow the links down to the desired index. This is different from an array where we could directly access any location.
- This difference in access time for a specific location in a list is a significant difference in the array and linked implementations.

2. Then we must "remove" it. We must do this in such a way that the rest of the list is still connected: - We must link the previous node to the next node - However, by the time we find the node we want to delete, we have "passed" up the node we need to link. Since the links are one way we can't go back, we need to find the node BEFORE the one we want to remove, then get the one we want to remove and the one after that, and change the links appropriately.

Note that in the `getNodeAt()` method we assumed:
1. List is non-empty
2. givenPosition is valid
- We could make these assumptions, because the method is private. As class designers, we only call this method under valid circumstances. Users of the class cannot call this method, so there is no problem for them.

However, if this were a public method (E.g., `public T getEntry(int givenPosition)`), the index test is done BEFORE `getNodeAt()` is called and if the test is false an exception is thrown.

Also note the special cases:
- if the index is invalid we cannot delete
- deleting the front value
- deleting the last remaining value (also the front value)

Let's consider the case where we wish to delete the front value. In this case, the Node before the nodeToRemove will be ????. Thus, in this case we must change the `firstNode`.
```Java
public T remove(int givenPosition)
{
   T result = null;                    // initialize return value
   if ((givenPosition >= 1) && (givenPosition <= numberOfEntries))
   {
	// at this point list is not empty
	if (givenPosition == 1) // case 1: remove first entry
	{
	   result = firstNode.getData();
	   firstNode = firstNode.getNextNode();
	}
	else  // case 2: givenPosition > 1
	{
	   Node nodeBefore = getNodeAt(givenPosition-1);
	   Node nodeToRemove = nodeBefore.getNextNode();
 	   result = nodeToRemove.getData();
	   Node nodeAfter = nodeToRemove.getNextNode();
	   nodeBefore.setNextNode(nodeAfter);
	}  // end if
	numberOfEntries--;
	return result;  // return result
   } // end if
   else throw new IndexOutOfBoundsException("Illegal Index");
}  // end remove
```

#### Variations on Singly linked List
We discussed before that if we are inserting a node at the end of the list, we must traverse the entire list first to find the "previous" last node. This is inefficient if we do a lot of adds to the end of the list. We could save time if we kept an additional instance variable (`lastNode`) that always refers to the end of the list. Now adding to the end of the list is easy! However, with an extra instance variable we may now have additional special cases!

Thus, adding an extra instance variable to save time with one operation can increase the complexity of other operations(Only by a small amount here, but we still need to consider it)

Let's look at an operation both without and with the lastNode reference (`remove()`)

When, if at all, will we need to worry about the lastNode reference?

**Normal case**: We remove a node from the "middle" of the list and the lastNode reference does not change at all

**Special case**:
1. Removing the last (end) node in the list
	- This clearly will affect the lastNode reference
2. Removing the only node in the list - Clearly this case is also 1) above, since the only node is also the last node - However, we should consider it separately, since there may be other special cases that may occur if the list is becoming empty
   How do we know when this case occurs? How do we handle it?

```Java
public T remove(int givenPosition)
{
   T result = null;
   if ((givenPosition >= 1) && (givenPosition <= numberOfEntries))
   {
```

The following code handles deleting the only node. Note that this code is within the special case to handle removing the front node. A single node is both the front and the back node
```Java
	// assert !isEmpty();
	if (givenPosition == 1)
	{
	   result = firstNode.getData();
	   firstNode = firstNode.getNextNode();
	   if (numberOfEntries == 1)
		lastNode = null;
	}
	else
	{
	   Node nodeBefore = getNodeAt(givenPosition-1);
	   Node nodeToRemove = nodeBefore.getNextNode();
	   Node nodeAfter = nodeToRemove.getNextNode();
	   nodeBefore.setNextNode(nodeAfter);
	   result = nodeToRemove.getData();
```

The following code handles deleting back node. Note that this is "its own" special case.
```Java
	   if (givenPosition == numberOfEntries)
	          lastNode = nodeBefore;

	}  // end if
	numberOfEntries--;
   } // end if
   else throw new IndexOutOfBoundsException("Illegal Index");

   return result;
}  // end remove
```

### Array-baed Implementation
Let's consider using an **array** for our List. This makes sense since an array can store multiple values and allow them to be manipulated in various ways. We also need to keep track of the logical size and for physical size, we will dynamically resize when needed, similar to the Bag(to allow for an arbitrary number of items).
```Java
private T [] list; // same as for Bag
private int numberOfEntries;
```

#### `Add()` method
Let's begin with the `add()` method. Note that unlike for the Bag ADT, we can add at item at an arbitrary index in the List. Since our underlying data structure is an array, we can get to the index easily due to direct access. However, now we must **shift** to make room for the new item.
```Java
public void add(int givenPosition, T newEntry)
{
	checkIntegrity();  // author does for all ADTS
	if ((givenPosition >= 1) && 
		(givenPosition <= numberOfEntries + 1)) 
	{	
      		if (givenPosition <= numberOfEntries)
      			makeRoom(givenPosition);	
      		list[givenPosition] = newEntry;
      		numberOfEntries++;
		ensureCapacity(); // look at this code also
	}
	else
		throw new IndexOutOfBoundsException(“Error”);
} // end add
```
Note that the textbook author does not use index `0` of the array; Instead, the items will be in `list[1]` thru `list[numberOfEntries]`. Thus the author makes the underlying array size `N+1` for a List of capacity `N`.

How do we shift the items? We use a basic 'shifting' algorithm, `makeRoom()`. This is pretty simple, but we need to be careful to shift from the correct side. If we start on the wrong side, we will copy, not shift.
```Java
private void makeRoom(int givenPosition)
{
// assert: (newPosition >= 1) && (newPosition <= numberOfEntries+1)
// move each entry to next higher index, starting at end of
// list and continuing until the entry at newPosition is moved
   int newIndex = givenPosition;  int lastIndex = numberOfEntries;  
   for (int index = lastIndex; index >= newIndex; index--)
	list[index+1] = list[index];
} // end makeRoom
```
Notice that this method is `private`, as shifting is something that is abstracted to the user.

#### `remove()` method
Well, we can `add()` to our List, but what about removing data? Since the data must stay *contiguous*, in a sense we are doing the opposite of what we did to insert. We must:
1. Remove and return the item
2. Shift the remaining items over to fill in the gap
3. Decrement numberOfEntries
```Java
public T remove(int givenPosition) 
{
	checkIntegrity();
	if ((givenPosition >= 1) && (givenPosition <= 							numberOfEntries))
	{	// get entry to be removed
		// assert: !isEmpty();
		T result = list[givenPosition]; 
	
	// move subsequent entries toward entry to be removed, 
	// unless it is last in list
		if (givenPosition < numberOfEntries)
			removeGap(givenPosition);
		list[numberOfEntries] = null;
		numberOfEntries--;
		return result;
	} // end if
	else
		throw new IndexOutOfBoundsException(“Error”);
} // end remove
```
Again, note that the List positions here go from 1 to length and index 0 is unused.

How do we shift this time? Again a basic "shifting" algorithm, `removeGap()`, – but, now we go the other way. Again, we must still be careful about where to start.
```Java
private void removeGap(int givenPosition)
{
// assert:(givenPosition >= 1) && (givenPosition < numberOfEntries)
// shifts entries that are beyond the entry to be
// removed to next lower position.
	int removedIndex = givenPosition;  
	int lastIndex = numberOfEntries;
	for (int index = removedIndex; index < lastIndex; index++)
		list[index] = list[index+1];
} // end removeGap
```
Note that we did not need to `removeGap()` for the Bag, but we do for the List. This is because the List must maintain positional ordering.

#### Other methods
The approach to implementing the other methods should be the same, and
they are implemented in the text([AList.java](handout/AList.java)).

## Standard Java List Classes
We mentioned previously that in standard Java there is a `List` interface similar to the author's `ListInterface`. So how is the standard List implemented? `ArrayList` is a class developed as part of the standard Java Collections Framework. It is built from scratch to implement the List interface; and uses a dynamic expanding array (similar to what we discussed but with a slightly different size increase factor). In real applications where a List is needed you will likely use `ArrayList`.

`Vector` is a class created before the Java Collections Framework was developed. It was designed to be a dynamically expanding collection. So, when the Collections Framework was developed, `Vector` was retrofitted into it through the addition of the standard List methods. However, Previous methods were also kept, so for a lot of operations there are two (almost) equivalent methods in the Vector class, for example: `public E remove(int index)` and `public void removeElementAt(int index)`. Note that the return types are a bit different.

Also in standard Java, a `LinkedList` is a doubly-linked list that implements List which also implements Queue.
