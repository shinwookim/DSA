# Stacks
## Introduction
One of the simplest and most commonly-used data structures is the **Stack**. In a stack, data is added and removed from one end only (typically called the top). Logically, the top item is the only one that can even be seen. Real-life examples of stacks can include:
- a stack of trays at a cafeteria
- post-it notes (although you don't often put post-its back on the stack)
- carts at a store
The fundamental operations of a stack are:
- **Push** an item onto the top of the stack
- **Pop** an item from the top of the stack
- Peek at the top item without disturbing it
```Java
public interface StackInterface<T>
{
   /** Adds a new entry to the top of this stack.
       @param newEntry  An object to be added to the stack. */
   public void push(T newEntry);
   
   /** Removes and returns this stack's top entry.
       @return  The object at the top of the stack. 
       @throws  EmptyStackException if stack is empty before the op. */
   public T pop();
  
   /** Retrieves this stack's top entry.
       @return  The object at the top of the stack.
       @throws  EmptyStackException if the stack is empty. */
   public T peek();
  
   /** Detects whether this stack is empty.
       @return  True if the stack is empty. */
   public boolean isEmpty();
  
   /** Removes all entries from this stack. */
   public void clear();

```
A stack organizes data by <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;">L</span>ast <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;">I</span>n <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;">F</span>irst <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;">O</span>ut, or LIFO (or FILO - <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;">F</span>irst <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;">I</span>n <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;">L</span>ast <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;">O</span>ut). This access, although simple, is useful for a variety of problems. Let's look at a few applications before we discuss the implementation.
- Run-time Stack for method calls (especially recursive calls)
	- We will see this when we discuss recursion in a couple of weeks. When a method is called, its activation record is pushed onto the run-time stack. When it is finished, its activation record is popped from the run-time stack. This is why exceptions that crash your program have a "call stack trace". It's a trace of the calls that were placed on the run-time stack.
- Testing for matching parenthesis:
	- `(()())()` - match
	- `((((()))))` - match
	- `((())` - don't match (not enough right parens)
	- `())(` - don't match (parens out of order, or too many right parens)
	- `([)]` - don't match (wrong paren type)

How can we code this using a Stack? What are the different cases and what do do in each case?
1. We encounter a left paren
	- Push onto stack
2.  We encounter a right paren
	- Check the stack
		If empty, throw ERROR – No left paren to match right
		If not empty, Pop stack and check the character
			If it does not match the left paren, ERROR – paren types don't match
			Else continue
3. We have read in all of the input
	- Check the stack
		If NOT empty, throw ERROR – No right paren to match left
```Java
public static boolean checkBalance(String expression)
{
      StackInterface<Character> openDelimiterStack = new ArrayStack<Character>();
      int characterCount = expression.length();
      boolean isBalanced = true;
      int index = 0;
      char nextCharacter = ' ';
      while (isBalanced && (index < characterCount))  {
          nextCharacter = expression.charAt(index);
          switch (nextCharacter)  {
              case '(': case '[': case '{':
                 openDelimiterStack.push(nextCharacter);
                 break;             
              case ')': case ']': case '}':
                 if (openDelimiterStack.isEmpty())  isBalanced = false;
                 else  {
                    char openDelimiter = openDelimiterStack.pop();
                    isBalanced = isPaired(openDelimiter, nextCharacter);
                 } // end if
                 break;   
	    default: break; // Ignore unexpected characters
	}  // end switch
         index++;
      } // end while 
      if (!openDelimiterStack.isEmpty())
         isBalanced = false;   
      return isBalanced;
} // end checkBalance
```

Stacks can also be used to evaluate **post-fix expressions**, where *operators follow operands*. This is useful since no parentheses are needed.
For example: `20 10 6 - 5 4 * + 14 - /`.
The idea behind post-fix notation is that each operator seen is used on the two most recently seen (or generated) operands. So for example, the "`-`" is used on `10` and `6`. 


### Evaluating post-fix expressions:
Read next character
	If it is an *operand*, push it onto the stack
	If it is an *operator*
		`Pop` right *operand*
		`Pop` left *operand*
		`Apply` *operator*
		`Push` result onto stack
After all characters have been read
	`Pop` final answer from stack
If we ever pop an empty stack or if stack is not empty at the end, the expression has an error

## Implementation
A Stack can easily be implemented using either an array or a linked list:
* Array:
    * Push — Add to *end* of logical array
    * Pop — Remove from *end* of logical array
* Linked List:
    * Push — Add to *front* of linked list
	* Pop — Remove from *front* of logical array
