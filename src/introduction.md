# Introduction & Review

The goal of this course is to study the basic data structures and algorithms of computer science (such as lists, stacks, queues, and hash tables), as well as their implementations. We will begin by examining each data structure from the *users* point of view and answering questions like "*What are these data structures and how do I use them in my programs?*" Then, we will shift our focus to the *implementers* point of view, studying the various ways in which each data structure can be implemented, and what each implementation entails (such as run-time differences, code complexity, and modifiability). Lastly, we will use these data structures as the underlying foundation to build and examine algorithms which can solve many classical computer science problems.

To aid in our studies, we will use the [Java Programming Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)) to examine the specific implementations of each data structure and algorithm. In this process, we will attain a better understanding of programming ideas and techniques including [object-oriented programming](oop.md), dynamic memory utilization, recursion (with backtracking) and other principles. Furthermore, as our programming skills improve, we will learn to utilize the vast capabilities of the Java programming language more effectively.

## Java Review
Since we will be heavily relying on Java to examine our data structures and algorithms, it is expected that you have some previous experience with it. That means, you should be familiar with:
- Basic Java program structure and syntax
- Control structures such as loops and conditionals
- Methods and method calls
	- Difference between static and instance methods
	- Concept of method overloading (AKA *ad hoc polymorphism*)
	- Recursive methods
- Variables and objects
	- Difference between Instance and method variables
	- Difference between objects and references
	- Dynamic nature of Java objects
- Classes
	- How to declare new classes
	- Difference between `private`, `public` and `protected` classes
	- Building new classes via **composition** and **inheritance**
	- **Polymorphism** via method overriding and dynamic binding
- Interfaces
- Arrays and array lists (contiguous memory)
- Nodes and linked lists (non-contiguous memory)
- Simple Java files and graphics
- Exception handling
