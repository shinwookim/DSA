# Bag ADT
## Introduction to the Bag ADT
Think of a real bag in which we can place things. There are no rules about:
1. How many items to put in
2. The order of the items
3. Duplicate items
4. What type of items to put in
  - However, we will make it homogeneous by requiring the items to be the same class or subclass of a specific Java type.
See [BagInterface.java](handout/BagInterface.java)
```Java
/**
	An interface that describes the operations of a bag of objects.
	@author Frank M. Carrano @author Timothy M. Henry @version 5.0  */
public interface BagInterface<T>
{
	/** Gets the current number of entries in this bag.
		 @return  The integer number of entries currently in the bag. */
	public int getCurrentSize();
	
	/** Sees whether this bag is empty.
		 @return  True if the bag is empty, or false if not. */
	public boolean isEmpty();
	
	/** Adds a new entry to this bag.
	    @param newEntry  The object to be added as a new entry.
	    @return  True if the addition is successful, or false if not. */
	public boolean add(T newEntry);
	
	/** Removes one unspecified entry from this bag, if possible.
			  @return  Either the removed entry, if the removal
			  was successful, or null. */
	public T remove();
	
	/** Removes one occurrence of a given entry from this bag, if possible.
              @param anEntry  The entry to be removed.
              @return  True if the removal was successful, or false if not. */
	public boolean remove(T anEntry);
	
          	/** Removes all entries from this bag. */
	public void clear();
	
	/** Counts the number of times a given entry appears in this bag.
		 @param anEntry  The entry to be counted.
		 @return  The number of times anEntry appears in the bag. */
	public int getFrequencyOf(T anEntry);
	
	/** Tests whether this bag contains a given entry.
		 @param anEntry  The entry to find.
		 @return  True if the bag contains anEntry, or false if not. */
	public boolean contains(T anEntry);
	
	/** Retrieves all entries that are in this bag.
		 @return  A newly allocated array of all the entries in the bag.
			Note: If the bag is empty, the returned array is empty. */
	public T[] toArray();
} // end BagInterface
```
Note that the `toArray()` a method is not as obviously appropriate as the others. As we saw previously, note what is **_NOT_** in the interface.
- There is **no specification of the data** for the collection. We will leave this to the implementation. Notice that the interface specifies only the behaviors. However, the implementation is at least partially implied: it must be some type of collection.
* The interface also **does not contain any method implementations**.

The interface also does not explicitly include things that probably should be included, such as:
- What the methods should do
- How special cases should be handled
  We typically have to handle these via **comments**, which this interface does provide.

For example, let's consider `public boolean add(T newEntry)` from two points of view:
## The Bag from the User's Point of View
1. What is the purpose / effect of the operation in the **normal** case?
	- We handle this via **preconditions** and **postconditions**
	     - Preconditions indicate what is assumed to be the state of the ADT prior to the method's execution
	     - Postconditions indicate what is the state of the ADT aftter the method's execution
	     - From the two we can infer the method's effect
     - E.g.: for `add(newEntry)` we might have:
	       **Precondition**: "*Bag is in a valid state containing `N` items*"
	       **Postconditions**:"Bag is in a valid state containing `N+1` items", "*`newEntry` is now contained in the Bag*"
		   - Note that `newEntry` may have already been contained in the Bag. However, after the `add()` we know for sure it is there.
	       - This is somewhat mathematical, so many ADTs also have operation descriptions explaining the operation in plainer terms—More complex operations may also have more complex conditions
			- Pre and postconditions can be very important for verifying correctness of methods
2. What **unusual** / **erroneous** situations can occur and how do we handle them?
	- Sometimes the unusual / erroneous circumstances are not obvious. Often they can be handled in more than one way.
	- E.g.: for `add(newEntry)` we might have
		1.  Bag is not valid to begin with due to previous error
		2.  newEntry is not a valid object
		Assuming we detect the problem, we could handle it by:
			1.  Doing a "no op"
			2.  Returning a false boolean value
			3.  Throwing an exception
	- We need to **make these clear to the user** of the ADT so he/she knows what to expect

The Bag is a simple ADT, but it does have its uses. One example is to generate some random integers and count how many of each number were generated. There are many ways to do this, but one is with a bag. 

See [Example5.java](handout/Example5.java).

Is this the most efficient way to generate the random integers and count the number generated? That depends on how the Bag ADT is implemented.

## The Bag from the Implementer's Point of View
Let's now look at the Bag ADT from an implementer's point of view. The implementer must answer the questions:
- How should I represent the data?
- How should I implement the operations?
	- Clearly, the implementation of the operations will be closely related to the representation of the data. Minimally, the data representation will "suggest" ways of implementing the operations. Note that these implementation questions (and the ones below) are (mostly) irrelevant to the client, but are quite important to the implementer.

### An Array-based Implementation
1. Let's first consider using an `array` to represent/hold the data. This makes sense since it can store multiple values and allow them to be manipulated in various ways.
```Java
private T [] bag; // array of T
// We will make this generic as previously discussed
```
Ok, so an array appears to answer the first question (how to represent the data), but there's still more to consider. We know the size of an array object is **fixed** once it is created. We also know that our Bag must be able to change in size (with adds and removes), meaning we must make more decisions about how to implement the array in our bag. Thus we need to create our array, then keep track of how many locations are used with some other variable:
```Java
private int numberOfEntries;
```

Recall the following ideas:
- **Physical size** of the Bag
	- Number of locations within the array
- **Logical size** of the Bag
	- Number of items being stored in the bag
	- The `numberOfEntries` variable is the maintaining the logical size
	- Adding an item to the Bag will change its logical size but not (necessarily) its physical size
So, how big should we make the array? And what if we run out of room?

#### Fixed Size Array
The idea:
- Initialize the array in the constructor
- Physical size be passed in as a parameter; this becomes the length/size of the array.
- Logical size (i.e. the number of array elements actually used) is maintained by the `numberOfEntries` variable.
- Once created, the physical size is constant as long as the list is being used.
- Once the array fills (i.e. logical size == physical size), any "add" operations will fail until space is freed (through "remove" or "clear").
  The advantage: easy for the ADT programmer to implement.
  The disadvantages:
- ADT user (programmer) may greatly over-allocate the array, wasting space but hopefully never running out of room.
- Program user (non-programmer) may run out of room at run-time, especially if the ADT user does not over-allocate.

Let's start with the simple method we have been discussing:
```Java
/** Adds a new entry to this bag.
	@param newEntry The object to be added as a new entry.
	@return True if the addition is successful, or false if not.
*/
public boolean add (T newEntry) {
	// what do we need to do in the normal case?
	// what do we do in the abnormal case?
}
```

Recall our data: `private T [] bag;`, `private int numberOfEntries;`

Since it does not matter where we put the new item, it makes sense to put it at the logical end of the array.
```Java
public boolean add(T newEntry)
	{
		checkIntegrity();
		boolean result = true;
		if (isArrayFull())  // cannot add if no
		{			// room
			result = false;
		}
		else  // add new item to array
		{  // assertion: result is true here
			bag[numberOfEntries] = newEntry;
			numberOfEntries++;
		} // end if
		return result;
	} // end add
```

How about a more complicated operation, like `remove(T anEntry)`?
```Java
/** Removes one occurrence of a given entry from this bag.
	@param anEntry The entry to be removed.
	@return True if the removal was successful, or false if not.
*/
public boolean remove(T anEntry){

}
```

What do we need to do here?
- Think of the "normal case":
	- Must first find the item
	- Then must remove it — How?
- Think of unusual or special cases
	- Bag is empty
	- `anEntry` is not found
```Java
/**
Removes one occurrence of a given entry from this bag.
	@param anEntry  the entry to be removed
	@return true if the removal was successful, or false if not
*/
public boolean remove(T anEntry)
{
	checkIntegrity();
	int index = getIndexOf(anEntry);
	T result = removeEntry(index);
	return anEntry.equals(result);
} // end remove
```

```Java
private int getIndexOf(T anEntry) // note: private
{
	int where = -1;
	boolean found = false;
	int index = 0;
	while (!found && (index < numberOfEntries))
	{
		if (anEntry.equals(bag[index]))
		{
			found = true;
			where = index;
		} // end if
		index++;
	} // end while
	return where;
} // end getIndexOf

private T removeEntry(int givenIndex) // also private
{
	T result = null;
	if (!isEmpty() && (givenIndex >= 0))
	{
	   result = bag[givenIndex];  // entry to remove
	   int lastIndex = numberOfEntries – 1;
	   bag[givenIndex] = bag[lastIndex];
		// replace entry to remove with last entry
	   bag[lastIndex] = null;
		// remove reference to last entry
		// numberOfEntries--;
	} // end if
      return result;
} // end removeEntry
```

Note that in the last line(`return anEntry.equals(result);`):
- If item is not found index will be -1
- If index is -1 removeEntry() will return null for result variable
- If result is null then...
	- Interesting case!
	- Author assumes the anEntry.equals(null) will return false
	- But it could generate an exception – it is a special case that may not be handled in the equals method for type T
	- Probably not the best way to implement this!

Approach to implementing the other methods should be the same

1. What is the method supposed to do?
2. What can go wrong and what do we do about it?
3. Does our code do what we want it to do?

See text for discussion of more operations
See [ArrayBag.java](handout/ArrayBag.java) for entire implementation

#### Dynamic Size Array
The idea:
- Array is created of some initial size
	- Constructor can allow programmer to pass the size in, or we can choose some default initial size
- Recall that Java arrays once created have a fixed size. Thus we cannot make an existing array bigger.
- Thus, if the bag array becomes filled, we must:
  1.  Create a new, bigger array
  2.  Copy the data from the old array into the new one
  3.  Assign the new array as our working array

This should be transparent to the bag user:
- The idea of resizing the array is not specified in `BagInterface<T>`
- User just wants `add()` to always work

Some questions we must consider are:
1.  How big to make the new array?
    1. Clearly it must be bigger than the old array, but how much bigger?
       - If we make the new array too small, we will have to resize often, causing a lot of overhead
       - If we make the new array too large, we will be wasting a lot of memory
    2. Let's make the **new array 2X the size of the old one**. This way we have a lot of new space but are not using outrageously more than we had before.
2.  How do we copy the values from the old array into the new array?
	- This is pretty easy – just start at the beginning of the old array and copy index by index into the new array
	- Not as easy for `RandIndexQueue` due to circular access
	- Note that we are copying references, so the objects in the new array are the same objects that were in the old array
3.  What happens to the old array?
	- It is garbage collected

In a Bag with full array:
1. Make a new array of double the size
2. Copy the data to the new array (note: copying references so objects are the same)
3. Assign bag reference to new array
4. Old array is garbage collected
5. temp goes away at end of method call
   
See: [ResizableArrayBag.java](handout/ResizableArrayBag.java).
Also compare [Example6.java](handout/Example6.java) with [ArrayBag.java](handout/ArrayBag.java).

Resizing:
```Java
public boolean add(T newEntry)
{
	checkintegrity();
	if (isArrayFull())
	{   doubleCapacity();  }
	bag[numberOfEntries] = newEntry;
	numberOfEntries++;
	return true;
} // end add

```
1. If array is not full this is identical to fixed array version.
2. The resizing process is transparent to the user of the ResizableArrayBag class
3. For this operation, `add()` always succeeds
```Java
private void doubleCapacity()
{
	int newLength = 2 * bag.length;
	checkCapacity(newLength);
	bag = Arrays.copyOf(bag, 2 * bag.length);
} // end ensureCapacity
```

A couple of notes about this method:
1.  The [Arrays.copyOf](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Arrays.html#copyOf%28T[],%20int%29) method is provided by Java. It does most of the hard work here.
2.  `checkCapacity()` makes sure size is not too big
3.  We never change `numberOfEntries` in this method. Why don't we?
    - Logical Bag is not changed by this method

### Data Structures and Memory Layout
There are two approaches to using memory when building a data structure. Both bag implementations above use **contiguous memory**: locations are next to each other in memory. Given the address of the first location, we can find all of the others based on an offset from the first. Consider the array declaration:
```Java
int[] vals = new int[3];
```
The memory looks like this: ![[contiguous memory.png]]

The reference variable holds the address of the array. Under each element of the array is the array index (`0`, `1`, `2`) and the memory address of each position in the array (`16`, `20`, `24`). The first element is at position `16` in memory, the second is at position `20`, and the third at position `24`. The position of each element is `4` bytes greater than the position of the previous position because the size of an `int` is `4` bytes.

#### Benefits of Contiguous Memory
Contiguous memory has many benefits:
- We have direct access to individual items. Access of item `val[i]` can be done in a single operation. Its position is calculated by: $$\verb|address_of(val|) + \verb|size_of(int)|*\verb|i|$$
- **Direct access** allows for random access, which permits us to use efficient algorithms such as **Binary Search** to find an item, which does not sequentially examine each element of the array.
- Arrays and array-based data structures are also **fairly simple and easy to use**.

#### Drawbacks of Contiguous Memory
Unfortunately, there are also drawbacks to contiguous memory:
1. Allocation of the memory must be done at once, in a large block as we just discussed
	- If we allocate too much memory we are being wasteful
	- If we do not allocate enough, we will run out.
     - As we saw, it is possible to allocate a new array, copy the values from the old to the new array, and continue using this new array, but this takes time to do.
2. Inserting or deleting data "at the middle" of an array may require shifting of the other elements. However, this also requires some time to do.

Focusing on these drawbacks, is there an alternative way of storing a collection of data that avoids these problems?

What if we can **allocate our memory in small**, **separate pieces**, one for each item in the collection? Now we allocate exactly as many pieces as we need. Now we do not have to shift items, since all of the items are separate anyway.

But how do we keep track of all of the pieces? We let the pieces keep track of each other! Let each piece have 2 parts to it:
  1.  One part for the data it is storing
  2.  One part to store the location of the next piece

### A Link-based Implementation
#### Aside: LinkedList
The idea behind a linked list is that if we know where the **beginning** of the list is and **each link** knows where the **next one** is, then we can access all of the items in the list. Our problems with contiguous memory now go away.
![[linked list.png]]

Allocation can be done one link at a time, for as many links as we need. Therefore `Logical Size` = `Physical Size`. Also, new links can be "linked up" anywhere in the list, without needing to shift elements around to make room.

To put a new node "**after**" some node `X`:
- Link the `newNode` to the **node after `X`**
- Link the **next value for `X` to the `newNode`**
	- Clearly, no shifting is necessary.

##### Linked-List Implementation Variations
The simple linked-list we just discussed is a singly-linked list
- Links go in one direction only
- We can easily traverse the list from the front to the back
- We CANNOT go backwards through the list at all
- This list is simple and (relatively) easy to implement, but has the limitations of any "one way street"
- This implementation is developed in Chapter 3

There are other variations of linked lists:
- Doubly linked list where:
	- Each node has two links – one to the successor and one to the predecessor
	- We can move in both directions in the list
    - We get more general access and can be more useful. This is more beneficial if we have a reference to the end of the list as well as the beginning (ex: author's `Deque`), or we make it circular (ex: standard JDK `LinkedList`).
	- Some operations maybe faster, but more overhead is involved.
- Circular linked list
	- End node circles back to front
	- Can be effectively used for a Queue (but not a Deque)

#### LinkedBag Implementation
The key to implementation is how each link is implemented. As we said, two parts are needed, one for data and one to store the location of the next link.

We can do this with a **self-referential data type**. A **`node`** is a common name for a link in a linked-list. It is called "self-referential" because inside itself, we reference another `node`.
```Java
class Node<T> {
	private T data;
	private Node<T> next;
	//...
}
```

```Java
public class LinkedBag<T> implements BagInterface<T>
{
	private Node firstNode;
	private int numberOfEntries;
	//...

	private class Node
	{
		private T data;
		private Node next;

		private Node(T dataPortion)
		{ this(dataPortion, null); }
        
		private Node(T dataPortion, Node nextNode)
		{ data = dataPortion; next = nextNode; }
	}
	//...
} // class LinkedBag
```

Notice that our `Node` is implemented inside the `LinkedBag` class. This type of class is called a private **inner class**. Why is it done this way? Since `Node` is declared within `LinkedBag`, methods in `LinkedBag` can access private declarations within `Node`. This is a way to get "around" the protection of the private data.
- LinkedBag will be needing to access `data` and `next` of its `Node`s in many of its methods.
- We could write accessors and mutators within `Node` to allow this access, but it is simpler for the programmer if we can access `data` and `next` directly.
- However, they are still `private` and cannot be accessed outside of `LinkedBag`.
- On the downside, with this implementation, we cannot use `Node` outside of the `LinkedBag` class, because it is a `private` class declared within `LinkedBag`.

###### `add()` Method
Now let's see how we would implement some of our `BagInterface` methods using this linked list version of a bag. We'll start with the `add()` method:
```Java
public boolean add (T newEntry)
{
    Node newNode = new Node(newEntry); // create Node
    newNode.next = firstNode; // link it to prev. front
    firstNode = newNode; // set front to new Node

    numberofEntries++; // increment entries

    return true;
}
```

Note that the insertion is at the front of the bag.
- New `Node` is created and `newEntry` is put in it.
- New `Node` becomes new front of list, pushing old front back
	- Since BagInterface does not specify where to insert, we again do what is most convenient for our implementation—For us, that is the front.
	- Since the Bag is not sorted, it does not logically matter where we insert new values.
- It was easier to add at the back of the array, but it is easier to add at the front of the linked list!

But now, consider the special case: "When bag is empty". What will happen? The `firstNode` will be null, which can lead to problems.

###### `contains()` Method
Similar to the array, we will use the **sequential search**. (I.e., We start at the beginning and proceed down the bag until we find the item or reach the end)
```Java
public boolean contains(T anEntry)
{
	boolean found = false;
	Node currentNode = firstNode;

	while (!found && (currentNode != null))
	{
		if (anEntry.equals(currentNode.data))
			found = true;
		else
			currentNode = currentNode.next;
	} // end while
	return found;
} // end contains
```
Notice that instead of `i++`, we use `currentNode = currentNode.next` to increment.

Notice that the loop will terminate when either `found == true` or `null` is reached (in which case `found == false`).

##### `remove()` Method
```Java
/** Removes one occurrence of a given entry from this bag.
    @param anEntry The entry to be removed.
    @return True if the removal was successful, or false if not.
*/
public boolean remove(T anEntry)
```
We want to remove an arbitrary item from the Bag. How do we do this? Think about the `contains()` method that we just discussed. How is remove similar and how is it different?
1.  **Find** the entry in question
    - But now we need more than just a boolean result. We must store a **reference** to the actual node so that we can do something with it.
2.  Then **remove** it
    - Must unlink the node from the list

Consider again the properties of a Bag: the data is in no particular order. So, we could remove the actual Node in question, but perhaps we can do it more easily. Notice that the front Node is very easy to remove. We can simply set the firstNode to the secondNode. So let's:
1. Copy the item in the front Node to the Node that we want to remove.
2. Remove the front Node.

Logically, we have removed the data we want to remove. Keep in mind that the **Nodes are not the data**, they are simply a mechanism for accessing the data. Also keep in mind that this would NOT be ok if the data need to stay in some kind of order.
```Java
public boolean remove(T anEntry)
{
	boolean result = false;
	Node nodeN = getReferenceTo(anEntry);
	if (nodeN != null)
	{
	   nodeN.data = firstNode.data; // copy data from
	   firstNode = firstNode.next;  // first Node and
	   numberOfEntries--;        // delete that Node
	   result = true;     // Operation succeeds
	} // end if

	return result;
} // end remove

```

```Java

 	private Node getReferenceTo(T anEntry)
	{
		boolean found = false;
		Node currentNode = firstNode;

		while (!found && (currentNode != null))
		{
			if (anEntry.equals(currentNode.data))
				found = true;
			else
				currentNode = currentNode.next;
		} // end while
		return currentNode;
	} // end getReferenceTo

```

Comparing this `remove()` to the one from `ArrayBag`, we notice that both move some data, but if different ways. ArrayBag moves that last item to "empty" spot and LinkedBag moves first item to "empty" spot. Either is accepatble since order does not matter.

See [Example7.java](handout/Example7.java) for other methods in `LinkedBag<T>`

#### `Node` as a Separate (non-inner) Class
Some object-oriented purists believe it is better to never "violate" the private nature of a class' data. I.e., They want to make `Node` into a separate class. This has the added benefit of being reused in other code.

If done this way, the `Node` class must also be a parameterized type:
```Java
public class Node<T>
{
    private T data;
    private Node<T> next;

    //...
```

```Java
public class LinkedBag2<T> implements BagInterface<T>
{
    private Node<T> firstNode;
    //...
}
```
Access to `next` and `data` fields must now be done via accessors and mutators, so these must be included in the `Node<T>` class.
- E.g., `getData()`,`getNextNode()` accessors
- E.g., `setData()`, `setNextNode()` mutators

Let's look at a method in LinkedBag.java we have already discussed, but now using this variation: `remove()`.
```Java
public boolean remove(T anEntry)
{
	boolean result = false;
	**Node**<T> nodeN = getReferenceTo(anEntry);
	if (nodeN != null)
	{
	    **nodeN.setData(firstNode.getData());**
	    **firstNode = firstNode.getNextNode();**
	    numberOfEntries--;
	    result = true;
	}
	return result;
}
```
- Note that `getReferenceTo()` would also be different, using accessors and mutators rather than direct access to the nodes
